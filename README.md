# Otsuthreshold
Otsu thresholding algorithm for converting grayscale images to binary images. We compare this algorithm with adaptive thresholding for OCR functionalities.

OCR is performed using Tesseract, do install Tesseract to run these files.

OCR results are generated through tesseract which takes the thresholded binary image as an input:

afternoon

Under Schoo! Age Children.While we love the younger children, it can be disruptive and
inappropriate to have them on campus during schoo! hours. There may be special times
that they may be invited or can accompany a parent volunteer, but otherwise we ask that
you adhere to our ~ï¿½ policy for the benefit of the students and staff. |
